# Lab 08 - Applying and Testing Hold Policies in an eDiscovery Case

- Login to <https://purview.microsoft.com>
- In the left-hand menu, select Solutions | eDiscovery
- If not taken there automatically, select Cases and click "Create case"
- Assign a name to your case (e.g., "Insider Trading Investigation")
- Optionally apply a description (e.g., "Execute and process scans for information that could indicate illegal insider trading activity")
- Click "Create"
- After the case has been created, click "Cases" in the top-level breadcrumb to return to the "Cases" dashboard
- Review the dashboard including the various attributes associated to each case
- Notice the "Delete case" and "Close case" option for each case
- Click the case to drill down into case details
- Click "Case settings" to review (and adjust if required) the case's configuration
- Close the settings and navigate to the "Data sources" tab and add 2 - 3 individuals
- From the "Searches" tab, create a new search - assign a name (e.g., "Evidence Retrieval") and optionally a description (e.g., "Search for any evidence indicative of insider trading at the company")
- Click "Add sources" to add specific sources to the search
- For "Scope items by", click "All sources in this case" and select the 2 or 3 users previously added to the case
- Alternatively, you can add additional sources by setting "Scope items by" to "All sources in the tenant (default)"; try adding a group
- Click "Manage" to define the data sources that will be searched as part of the case
- Try sending some emails and Teams messages
- Add a Word document to one of the user's OneDrive locations
- Add an Excel spreadsheet to one of the other user's OneDrive locations
- Explore results in Statistics and Sample views (generate or regenerate the views as required)
- Explore adding a query to fine tune the search results to focus on a specific time period, keywords, or use the KQL query language to define the filter
- Add more documents to the OneDrive locations (some that match and some that do not)
- Update statistics and samples views to see what was uncovered with the latest configuration
- Try sending some emails to different people and Teams messages to different people (some that match and some that do not)
- Regenerate views for statistics and sample data and review
- Apply a hold to 2 of the 3 users
- Apply a hold to the group using a query to filter what gets held
- Verify that the hold is on and review each hold item for details
- Testing Preservation (Goal: Attempt deletions and show that held items cannot be permanently removed)
  - Email Deletion Test
    - Delete an email previously retrieved in a search, then empty their Deleted Items folder
    - Back in Purview, rerun a Search scoped to that mailbox and looking for a specific keyword
    - Result: The deleted email still appears in search results—shows that hold preserved it
  - OneDrive File Deletion Test
    - Delete a file from OneDrive and then remove it from the Recycle Bin
    - In Purview, run a search scoped to that OneDrive location
    - Result: The file still surfaces—hold has preserved a copy
  - Teams Chat Deletion Test
    - In a Teams client, delete a chat message in scope of the hold
    - Because chat messages are stored in the user’s mailbox, rerun your mailbox search
    - Result: The deleted chat message is still returned
- Inspecting Versioning and Recovery
    -OneDrive Version History
        - In the user’s OneDrive UI, select the held file → Version history
        - Show that prior versions (or a “deleted” version) can be restored even though the user emptied their Recycle Bin
  - Recovering Email via eDiscovery
    - In your case Searches, click Export results for the mailbox search: choose All items, format PST, then Export
    - Open the exported PST in Outlook and demonstrate recovery of the “deleted” email.
- Removing and Testing Hold Release
  - Temporarily Disable the Hold
    - Go back to Holds, select the hold, and toggle Status to Off
    - Wait for processing to complete (may take a few minutes)
  - Re-test Deletion
    - Delete another related item
    - Rerun your Purview search—this time, the item should not be returned, confirming the hold is no longer preserving new deletions
- Create a Review Set
  - In your case, go to the Review sets tab and click + New review set
  - Enter a name and optional description
  - Click Create
  - The new Review set appears in the list with Status: Ready
- Add Search Results to the Review Set
  - Switch to the Searches tab, select your search
  - In the flyout, click Add results to review set
  - Choose Add to existing review set, and select the review set by name
  - Under What to add, keep “Indexed items that match your search query”
  - Click Add. Monitor the ingestion on the Jobs tab—when complete, your Review set is populated.
- Run Analytics: Duplicate Detection & Themes
  - Open the review set
  - From the toolbar, select Analytics > Run document & email analytics
  - In the pane, ensure Near duplicate detection, Email threading, and Themes are checked
  - Click Run
  - Wait for the job to complete (check Jobs tab)
- Exploring Duplicate Detection
  - In the Review set, click Analytics > Duplicate detection
  - View groups of near-identical documents (e.g. multiple copies of the same email or file)
  - Action Example:
    - Bulk-tag one representative per duplicate group as “Verified Unique”
    - Exclude duplicates from review by saving a filter query: DuplicateGroupId:empty (keeps only unique items)
- Exploring Themes (Topic Matching)
  - In the Review set, click Analytics > Themes
  - You’ll see automatically generated “themes” (clusters of related terms)
  - Action Example:
    - Filter on high-priority themes (e.g. Theme:“Confidential”) to focus on sensitive documents first
    - Create a Saved Filter named ConfidentialTheme and apply it to quickly re-filter the set
- Additional Review Set Actions
  - Email Threading: Group conversations so reviewers see full context.
    - Action: Collapse threads, then bulk-tag entire threads as “Reviewed” once any item in the thread has been coded
  - Tagging & Coding:
    - Create custom tags (e.g., Privilege, Responsive, Non-Responsive)
    - Apply tags to single or multiple items, then export tag reports
  - Saved Queries:
    - Save common filters (e.g. file type, date range, custodian) as reusable filter queries
  - Export:
    - Export only items tagged “Responsive” for production, with deduplication turned on to avoid redundant copies
- Discussion Points
  - Hold Scope: A single hold on mailboxes covers both email and Teams chats
  - Data Retention vs. Hold: Holds preserve items even if retention policies allow deletion
  - Performance Considerations: Large holds can impact indexing time; discuss strategies like scoped queries
