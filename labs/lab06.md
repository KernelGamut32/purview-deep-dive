# Lab 06: Data Retention & Records Management in Microsoft Purview

Students will create static and adaptive retention policies, build adaptive scopes, configure event-based retention, complete a disposition review, and connect the design to SC-100 architecture considerations.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Learning objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create **static** and **adaptive** retention policies in Microsoft Purview.
- Build **adaptive scopes** (Users/Sites/Groups) and use them in policies and label publishing.
- Configure **event-based retention** (event types, labels, asset IDs, events).
- Run a **disposition review** (single or multi-stage) and export proof of disposition.
- Tie retention and records decisions to **data residency** and **regulatory** requirements (SC-100 context).

---

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites (instructor/tenant)

- Microsoft 365 test tenant with access to the **Microsoft Purview portal**.
- Roles:
  - **Compliance Administrator** (or equivalent) for policy/label configuration.
  - **Scope Manager** (or equivalent) for **Adaptive scopes**.
  - **Disposition Management** for reviewers (often via a dedicated **mail-enabled security group**, e.g., `Disposition Reviewers`).
- Licensing: Microsoft Purview **Records management** features (E5 or Purview solutions trial).
- A SharePoint site for the lab (e.g., `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/RecordsLab`) with a **Documents** library.
  - Navigate to SharePoint using the "9 Dots" in the upper left
  - Click "Create site" and choose "Team site"
  - For template, use "Standard team" on the "From Microsoft" tab
  - Click **Use template**
  - Give the site a name (e.g., "key-documents") - use other defaults and click **Next**
  - Use the defaults for "Privacy settings" and "Select a language" and click **Create site**
  - Add the administrator account (MOD Administrator), add Adele Vance, and add Diego Siciliani (member of the Finance Team); click **Finish**
  - Click **Documents** and upload 2-3 sample files (.docx and .txt) - you can create the .txt file locally and upload; you can use the **New** button in the SharePoint document library to create a new Word document

> **Propagation timing note**  
> Retention policies, label publishing, and event synchronization can take time to deploy.

## ðŸ§­ Scenario used in this lab

**Contoso Finance**

- Teams **chats** for Finance users: retain **3 years** and then delete.
- All SharePoint/OneDrive content: retain **7 years** and then delete.
- HR records: labeled as **records** and require a **2-stage disposition**.
- Offboarding: **event-based retention** triggered by an **Employee Separation** event using an **Asset ID** (employee ID).

## Part A â€” Static retention policy for SharePoint & OneDrive (7 years)

1. Go to **Microsoft Purview portal** â†’ **Solutions** â†’ **Data Lifecycle Management** â†’ **Policies** â†’ **Retention policies** â†’ **New retention policy**
2. On the "Name your retention policy" page, assign a name of your choosing (e.g., "Global SPO/OD Retain 7y"); click **Next**
3. On the "Policy Scope" page, leave the default at "Full directory" and click **Next**
4. On the "Choose the type of retention policy to create", choose **Static** and click **Next**
5. The following locations only should be enabled: **SharePoint classic and communication sites** and **OneDrive accounts**; verify and click **Next**
6. On the "Decide if you want to retain content, delete it, or both", select "Retain items for a specific period"
7. Use "7 years" for the retention period
8. Use "When items were created" for retention period start basis
9. For "At the end of the retention period", select "Delete items automatically"
10. Click **Next**
11. On the "Review and finish" page, click **Submit** then click **Done**

> **Tip**: Teams **files** are stored in SharePoint/OneDrive and are covered by SharePoint/OneDrive retention. Teams **messages** require their own locations in a separate policy.

5. Unfortunately, in the sandbox, the retention labels are likely not available but this is where you would the label (and associated stage)
6. Click **Close** and return to the Purview portal

> **Note**: If the Asset ID field is read-only, ensure an **event-based** retention label is applied first.

### D4. Trigger an **Event** to start retention

## Part E â€” Disposition review (reviewersâ€™ experience)

> Use pre-staged items so you can demonstrate items ready for disposition.

1. On the Purview portal, use **Solutions** â†’ **Records Management** â†’ **Disposition**.
2. If labels were immediately available and could be assigned in "Compliance Details" for a document in SharePoint for example, you could select a disposition to review metadata and (if permitted via **Content Explorer Content Viewer**) preview content
3. You could also choose an action: **Dispose (delete)**, **Extend**, **Relabel**, or **Export proof of disposition**.

---

## Part F â€” Validate and troubleshoot

- **Policy/label status**:  
  - **Data Lifecycle Management** â†’ **Policies** â†’ **Retention policies** â†’ open a policy to view deployment status
  - **Records Management/Data Lifecycle Management** â†’ **Policies** â†’ **Label policies** for publishing status
- **Common blockers**:
  - Propagation delays (policy/label/event distribution)
  - Missing roles (e.g., **Disposition Management** for reviewers, **Content Explorer Content Viewer** for previews)
  - Using static scopes where adaptive scopes would reduce include/exclude limits

---

## Part G â€” Clean up (optional)

- Disable or delete demo **retention policies** and **label policies**.  
- Delete demo **labels** (only if unused and not regulatory/event-based).

---

## SC-100 tie-in: Residency, retention, and regulatory alignment

- **Data residency**: Design for where data at rest resides (e.g., multi-geo). Confirm which Purview data is stored in which regions and align to regulatory constraints.  
- **Retention as a control**: Map your policies/labels to obligations (e.g., SEC/FINRA/GDPR) using **Compliance Manager** assessments and templates.  
- **Operating model**: Prefer adaptive scopes for scale, mail-enabled security groups for disposition reviewers, and clear RBAC separation of duties.
